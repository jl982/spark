/**
 * A BitTorrent-like implementation of [[org.apache.spark.broadcast.Broadcast]].
 *
 * Different to [[TorrentBroadcast]], this implementation doesn't divide the object to broadcast.
 * In contrast, this implementation performs broadcast on executor side for a RDD. So the results
 * of the RDD does not need to collect first back to the driver before broadcasting.
 *
 * The mechanism is as follows:
 *
 * On each executor, the executor first attempts to fetch the object from its BlockManager. If
 * it does not exist, it then uses remote fetches to fetch the blocks of the RDD from other
 * executors if available. Once it gets the blocks, it puts the blocks in its own BlockManager,
 * ready for other executors to fetch from.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the element of RDD to be broadcasted.
 * @tparam U The type of object transformed from the collection of elements of the RDD.
 *
 * @param rdd The RDD to be broadcasted on executors.
 * @param mode The [[org.apache.spark.broadcast.BroadcastMode]] object used to transform the result
 *             of RDD to the object which will be stored in block manager.
 * @param id A unique identifier for the broadcast variable.
